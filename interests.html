        <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
        <p class="about">
            My interests lie at the intersection of music and film, being fascinated by the ways they shape our emotions and perceptions. 
            During my Master's studies, I analyzed a paper of notable interest (below), which resonated with my interest in the power of sound and visuals,
            providing a theoretical framework for further exploration.                  
            <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114844" target="_blank">Perception! Immersion! Empowerment! Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization.</a></p>
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            The paper explores the intersection between visualization and fictional superpowers. It argues that visualizations can empower people in ways that resemble superpowers,
            and that studying these fictional abilities can inspire the creation of new visualization techniques. I highly recommend reading this paper, and should you be interested,
             I've outlined my comments below. 
        </p>

        <h3>Paper Review</h3>
        
        <p class="about">
            This paper offers a unique perspective on visualization design by connecting it with the concept of superpowers. Even without deep field knowledge, this approach seems fresh and
            could spark innovation in visualization research.  
        </p>
				
        <p class="about">
            It's two frameworks provide valuable structures, that not only guide the creation of new empowering visualizations, but could also be used to deconstruct existing ones, 
            identifying the superpower-like mechanisms they employ. This could lead to a deeper understanding of why certain visualizations are more effective than others.
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            The first framework's classification helps us understand the underlying mechanisms that make the fictional abilities possible, allowing us to design visualizations 
            that mimic or even enhance them. The second framework provides concrete starting points for designing visualizations that actively augment human perception and cognition.
        </p>

        <p class="about"> 
            The paper effectively combines the classifications of the frameworks, demonstrating the potential of visualization tools to enhance perception and cognition with real-world applications.
            Though incomplete in scope and technical specifics, the integration offers a promising basis upon which future visualization efforts can build.  However, considerable work remains to translate
            this vision into practical tools with clear benefits. Factors such as managing cognitive load, designing user-friendly interfaces, and navigating current technological limitations will require careful consideration.
        </p>
        
        <p class="about"> 
            While the paper ingeniously examines enhancing human perception and cognition, it doesn't fully explore the critical ethical implications of designing such tools. Considerations around 
            privacy concerns, potential for manipulation, and the risk of broader societal harm, need to be carefully addressed as visualization technologies advance.
        </p>

        <p class="about">
            In general, this paper goes beyond simply organizing existing visualization techniques. It introduces a transformative approach to visualization that has the potential to empower users and 
            fundamentally change their interactions with data. The frameworks and examples provided, offer researchers and designers a powerful toolkit to create visualizations that both inform and inspire.
