        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p class="about">
            While I enjoy seasonal hobbies such as snowboarding and surfing, my true passion is cycling. 
            Greece is full of biking routes and trails, most of which are documented and shared on dedicated fitness apps.

        <p class="about">
            The Strava Heatmap is a feature provided by the fitness tracking app Strava, which showcases a global heatmap of activities recorded by its users. 
            Below is a filtered Strava heatmap specifically illustrating popular cycling routes, utilizing aggregated GPS data from millions of Strava users around Europe.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            I find this visualization interesting, as it offers a rapid overview of European cycling trends, highlighting bike usage analogies across countries and specific regions. 
            I also appreciate this particular color scheme representation, which I find eye pleasing and despite the large scale of the map, it manages to reveal details effectively without requiring zooming.            
            In addition to the aforementioned points, this heatmap serves as a helpful tool for discovering cycling paths (or bike travel destinations), offering valuable insights into popular routes.
